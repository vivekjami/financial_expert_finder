### Unit I: Conventional Software Management & Software Economics

#### Q1. Explain the advantages and limitations of the Waterfall Model in conventional software management.

**Answer:**  
The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest process models used in software engineering. It is characterized by a sequential, linear process in which each phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC) must be completed before the next begins.  

**Advantages:**  
- **Simplicity & Clarity:** The model’s sequential structure makes it easy to understand and manage.  
- **Structured Documentation:** Each phase produces clear deliverables and documentation, facilitating review and knowledge transfer.  
- **Defined Milestones:** Phases have measurable milestones that help in tracking project progress.  
- **Discipline & Control:** Strict phase-by-phase progression minimizes scope creep during early phases.

**Limitations:**  
- **Inflexibility:** Once a phase is completed, it is very difficult to go back and change requirements or design decisions.  
- **Delayed Testing:** Testing is deferred until after implementation, increasing the risk of late discovery of errors.  
- **Risk Exposure:** Early assumptions may be invalidated by later issues, making risk management more difficult.  
- **Customer Involvement:** Limited client feedback is integrated until the later phases, which may result in misaligned expectations.

#### Q2. Discuss the transition from conventional software engineering to an iterative process. Provide real-world examples.

**Answer:**  
Conventional software engineering, exemplified by the Waterfall Model, follows a rigid sequence that rarely accommodates change. Over time, industry experiences revealed the need for more flexibility, leading to the adoption of iterative approaches such as Agile, Scrum, and Extreme Programming (XP). Iterative processes emphasize frequent feedback, continuous testing, and incremental improvements.

**Key Points in the Transition:**  
- **Feedback & Adaptation:** Iterative models incorporate short development cycles (sprints), where each iteration results in a usable product increment that is reviewed and refined.  
- **Risk Mitigation:** By breaking down the work into manageable parts, risks are identified and mitigated early.  
- **Customer Collaboration:** Iterative processes involve customers continuously, ensuring that evolving requirements are effectively captured.  
- **Real-world Examples:**  
  - *Agile in Web Development:* Tech giants like Spotify and Amazon use Agile practices to quickly respond to market changes.
